    <h2>Hi! I'm Andy. Here is a little bit about me:</h2>    
    <p>A former product manager and business development manager with 14+ years of experience in consumer goods marketing.</p> 
    <p>Throughout my career I have mastered Excel and VBA as well as presentation software like PowerPoint.</p> 
    <p>I have extensive experience with statistical testing and data analysis. I have led successful cross-functional teams and</p> 
    <p>would regularly present to executive leadership. I would like to take those skills as well as my newly acquired knowledge</p>
    <p>of powerful data science tools like Python, MySQL, MongoDB, Tableau, Leaflet, HTML, CSS, & JavaScript and pivot into a new career as a data analyst.</p>
